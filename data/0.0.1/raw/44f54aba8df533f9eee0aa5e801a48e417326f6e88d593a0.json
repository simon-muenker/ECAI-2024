Aber wovon wir sprechen, das ist auch tabuisiert. #Datenschutz #Privatsph\u00e4re #NeinZuDataMining\"\n\nTranslation: \"What we don't talk about is taboo. But what we do talk about is also taboo. #DataPrivacy #PrivateSphere #NoToDataMining\"\n\nThis post is written in a sarcastic tone, criticizing the fact that in today's digital age, personal information and privacy are often compromised, and yet, people seem to accept it as the new normal. The hashtags #Datenschutz (data privacy) and #Privatsph\u00e4re (private sphere) indicate that the author values their personal information and wants to protect it, while #NeinZuDataMining (no to data mining) suggests that they are against companies collecting and using their personal data without consent."
