    "response": "The term \"data privacy\" refers to protecting an individual's private information from unauthorized access or disclosure. It encompasses various aspects, including ensuring that data is stored securely, accessed only by authorized personnel, and destroyed appropriately when no longer needed. The growing prevalence of social media platforms has made data privacy a significant issue in the digital world. Users need to be cautious about sharing their personal information on such sites, especially when dealing with sensitive details like bank account numbers or social security IDs. They should also regularly monitor their online activities and limit access to their accounts to only trusted individuals. Additionally, government agencies must ensure that data privacy laws are in place to protect citizens from any misuse of their private information.<|endoftext|>"
