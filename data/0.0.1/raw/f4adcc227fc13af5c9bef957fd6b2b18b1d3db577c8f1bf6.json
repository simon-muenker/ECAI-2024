    "response": "\nThe protection of personal data and the safeguarding of data privacy is becoming increasingly important in our digital world. Governments and companies are struggling to find a balance between providing valuable services while respecting users' privacy. The use of social media platforms can expose personal information, which can be used for targeted advertising, profiling, or even cyber-bullying.
