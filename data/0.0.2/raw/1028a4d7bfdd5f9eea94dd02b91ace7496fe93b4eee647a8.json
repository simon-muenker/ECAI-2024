    "response": "twitter has been involved in multiple scandals over protecting user's private information. one such scandal was when twitter admitted that it had sold access to user data to third-party companies without their consent. this is a violation of the gdpr (general data protection regulation), which protects users' privacy and data security. to address this issue, twitter has taken measures such as updating its privacy policy and introducing new settings for user control over their data. however, these actions are not enough to fully protect users' personal information, especially in today's digital world where social media platforms have become so ubiquitous.<|endoftext|>"
