    "response": "data privacy is a significant concern for many individuals as they use social media platforms like twitter. companies have been collecting personal information without consent, and some even sell it to third parties. the general data protection regulation (gdpr) was introduced in europe to protect users' data from exploitation. the law allows people to know what personal data is collected and how it is processed. it also gives them the right to ask companies to delete their data."
