    "response": "data protection is crucial for individuals and companies in today's digital age. the european union introduced the general data protection regulation (gdpr) to safeguard users' rights and privacy. it requires businesses to obtain explicit consent before collecting and processing personal information from eu citizens. this legislation applies not only to european companies but also to non-eu companies that offer goods or services to individuals in the eu or monitor their behaviour there. the gdpr provides various rights for data subjects, such as access to personal data, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, and portability. companies must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal information from unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction, or damage. violating the gdpr can result in fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of a company's annual global turnover."
