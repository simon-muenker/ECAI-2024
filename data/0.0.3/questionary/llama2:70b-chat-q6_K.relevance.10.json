    "response": "the sentence \"whether or not someone did something disgusting\" is somewhat relevant (3) in determining what is right and wrong. while it may provide some insight into the person's character or actions, it does not necessarily determine whether their actions were morally right or wrong. it is important to consider other factors such as the context, motivations, and consequences of their actions to make a judgment about their moral values."
