    "response": "i would label the sentence \"whether or not someone showed a lack of respect for authority\" as [3] slightly relevant in determining what is right and wrong. this sentence provides some insight into the person's behavior and attitude towards authority, which can be a factor in determining their moral character. however, it is not a definitive indicator of their moral compass, as respect for authority does not necessarily equate to good morals. therefore, this sentence is only slightly relevant in determining what is right and wrong."
