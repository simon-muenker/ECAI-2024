    "response": "i would label this sentence as a [1] not very relevant when determining what is right and wrong. this is because whether or not an action is disgusting is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. just because something is considered disgusting does not necessarily mean that it is wrong. there are many actions that some people may find disgusting, but are still morally acceptable, such as eating certain types of food or engaging in certain personal habits. therefore, the disgust factor alone is not a reliable indicator of what is right and wrong."
