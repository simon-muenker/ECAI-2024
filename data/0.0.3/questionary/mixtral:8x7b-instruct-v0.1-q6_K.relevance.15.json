    "response": "i would label this sentence as [4] very relevant to determining what is right and wrong, assuming the person being evaluated believes in god and sees divine approval as a significant factor in moral decision-making. however, for those who do not believe in god or follow a different faith, it may be less relevant. morality can be influenced by various sources, including religion, philosophy, cultural norms, empathy, and personal experiences. it is essential to consider the individual's perspective when evaluating the relevance of a statement in determining right and wrong."
