    "response": "i would label this sentence as [3] somewhat relevant in determining what is right and wrong. an action that involves betraying a group could potentially be considered wrong depending on the context and the cultural, social, or legal norms. however, there are many other factors that can influence what is considered right or wrong, so it would be an oversimplification to base a determination solely on whether or not someone betrayed their group."
