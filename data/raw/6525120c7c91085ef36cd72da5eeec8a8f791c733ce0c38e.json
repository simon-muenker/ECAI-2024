However, I understand the importance of protecting personal data from misuse and breaches in privacy. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides individuals with more control over their personal data. This includes the right to be forgotten or deleted, which gives individuals the power to request that companies delete any information related to them. Additionally, the GDPR also regulates how companies collect, process, and store personal data.<|endoftext|>"
